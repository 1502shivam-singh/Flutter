<h2> A Weather App developed by me in flutter </h2>

<h3>An incredibly simple to use weather app, with clean functionality and a beautiful UI.</h3>

<p>You can use this app to get the weather of any location 
<strong>ON THIS EARTH</strong> just by simply typing the name of that place!!! 😁</p>

<p>This App automatically tells you the weather of your current location on opening the app.
This app uses the openweathermap api to tell the temperature and weather of your location precisely.</p>
